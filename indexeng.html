    <p> 

    The purpose of this site is to show my skills and progression considering programming during our Ticorporate- project.
    On this frontpage you will find some information about me, about the site, and about our Project Acorn. <br> <br> 
    Tools - page will show what kind of tools I have used during the project, and also some short samples of the code I´ve been doing during 
    the Project, but obviously only a small part of everything. <br> <br>
    On Scrum- page there is just some small info about how we used scrum as a group, and also something small about my role as a scrum-master. <br>
    <br>

     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <img style="width: 30%; margin-right: 1%;" class="mie" src="media/acorn.png" alt="">
  
    <p>
    
    I´m 27-years old student on Jyväskylän Ammattikorkeakoulu, and at the moment finishing my second year. I´m studying to be an IT-tradenomi, in english probably 
    computer science, or something. My goal is to graduate around christmas 2022. I´m interested on developing softwares, and during this project, I have been 
    able to learn exactly the kind of stuff, that I want to do. My role has been pretty versatile, I have been doing work with angular on frontend, some JS on 
    backend, and I have done some stuff with databases also. 
    </p>

    <p id="pee">

      We have been creating an app for beginners to learn how to play guitar. At the moment there is couple of quizes, one practise for playing guitar, and also 
      we have prototype of guitar tuner, but it is not publishd yet. The app is created by using Angular and Node modules. For databases we have used MySQL. 
      In the app there is in-game money what you can get by doing some quizes or practises. With that money you can buy cool hats, guitars or books on our store. <br>
      You can check our website and demo on <a href="https://acorn.ticorporate.fi/">acorn.ticorporate.fi</a>
